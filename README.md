## Used Car Sell in India
This repository is an exhaustive analytical report on Used Cars Selling Industry in the Tier-1 Cities of

**2. Which car brands are majorly on sale.**<br/>
**3. Which fuel type and which hand cars are on sell in top 10 brands.**<br/>
**4. Distribution of Kms travelled by car by fuel type, owner type and Top 10 manufacturer.**<br/>
